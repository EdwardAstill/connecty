AISC permits the use of Elastic and ICR methods for weld analysis (maybe bolt analysis too)


Tables 2.5 give the available strengths for welds
...hard to read so we have a couple takeaways:
For Plug and slot, fillet and PJP:
- Filler metal should be equal to or less than the base metal strength 
- 0.75 is a conservative resistance factor for welds

For CJP:
For all oads the the strength of the joint is contolled byt hte strneght of the base metal (essientially you ignore the weld metal)
